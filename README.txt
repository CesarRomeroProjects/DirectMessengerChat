This code is a Direct Messaging application developed using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to send messages to other users through a server. The GUI allows users to open, create and close messaging files, send messages, view received messages, and configure server settings. The application stores sent and received messages in a DSU (Direct Send Unit) file format. The code is structured using object-oriented programming principles and the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern. It also implements error handling for invalid inputs and server connection issues.
